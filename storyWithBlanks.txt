I used to go to _1_ stores with my friends. We’d take the _1_ into Boston, and go to The _1_ District, which is this huge _1_ warehouse. Everything is arranged by _1_, and somehow that makes all of the _1_ _3_. It’s kind of like if you went through the _1_ in the Narnia books, only instead of finding _2_ and the White Witch and horrible Eustace, you found this magic _1_ world–instead of talking animals, there were _3_ boas and _3_ dresses and _3_ shoes, and _3_ shirts and _2_ and everything hung up on racks so that first you have black _1_, all together, like the world’s largest indoor funeral, and then blue dresses–all the blues you can imagine–and then red dresses and so on. Pink-reds and orangey reds and purple-reds and exit-light reds and candy reds. Sometimes I would close my eyes and Natasha and Natalie and Jake would drag me over to a rack, and rub a dress against my _1_. “Guess what _1_ this is.”
